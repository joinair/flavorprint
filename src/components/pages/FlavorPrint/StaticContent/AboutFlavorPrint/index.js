      <h2>Flavor Blending</h2>

      <div className="FlavorPrintStaticAbout-columns">
        <img
          alt=""
          className="FlavorPrintStaticAbout-imgLeft"
          src="/assets/images/static-images/fp-static-recipe.png"
        />

        <div className="FlavorPrintStaticAbout-par">
          <h4>So much flavor in every recipe and product!</h4>

          <p>
            The FlavorPrint displays all the flavors present in the
            recipe or product and each color is a different flavor.
          </p>

          <p>
            With almost infinite combinations, sometimes there are only
            a few flavors present, sometimes there are many! For example,
            the Arugula and Peach Salad recipe has 23 flavors in itâ€˜s
            flavor profile. What a complex present for your taste buds!
          </p>

      <h2>Flavor Intensity</h2>

      <div className="FlavorPrintStaticAbout-columns">
        <div className="FlavorPrintStaticAbout-par">
          <h4>Strong flavor? Weak flavor? Check the length!</h4>

          <p>
            Each ray displays just how intense the flavor is. The longer
            the ray, the more intense the flavor. For example this
            recipe has some HEAT with a smidge of CITRUSY.
